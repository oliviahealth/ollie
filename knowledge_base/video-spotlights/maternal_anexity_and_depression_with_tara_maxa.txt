My name is Tara Maxa and I am an RN but I'm also an MSN so I teach nursing students at the school of nursing for Texas A M but I'm also by trade a labor and delivery nurse and I have practiced for about 12 and a half years now [Music] so when we're talking about signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression you know it can be very individualized somebody may experience One symptom and their friend right next to them may not experience it experience that symptom at all so when we talk about anxiety in you know prenatally or after delivery which we refer to as a postpartum period that anxiety can look like extreme worry so it's very normal to worry when you have a new baby that you want to make sure you're doing everything okay when we talk about maternal anxiety we're talking about thoughts that become very intrusive thoughts that keep replaying in your mind over and over this worry that won't go away so it prevents you from sleeping it prevents you from eating it prevents you from doing those things that you would normally do on a daily basis because you're so consumed by those thoughts depression on the other hand is going to be maybe extreme sadness or guilt you know just wanting to sleep all the time or not wanting to do those things that you would normally do that you enjoy like going to the park or you know reading a book or something you're you don't feel like yourself so again those symptoms can be very versatile depending on who the person is but that's that's kind of a general idea of both of those.
