Hi I'm Stacy Brown mother of five the last of whom were unexpected triplets born at 28 weeks five days all together we have four girls and one boy howdy I'm Eric Brown the proud father of the five including the one boy who I like to call my Lone Ranger [Music] thank you so with multiples comes a multiple of factors no pun intended we were told that there would be the possibility that they could all come home at the same time two could come home one would be there one could come home to be there just all the varieties of ways in which they could come home what ended up happening is one of the girls came home at 55 days and then the other two came home at 73 days [Music] so the NICU did have controlled access for both to control security and exposure for not just our babies that were Nikki but all the babies that were in the NICU there was a phone that you'd call and the charge nurse would answer it and you would tell her who you were there to see and then she would Buzz the door you'd go in and it was a room with big sinks and have to wash your hands for three minutes and then you could go into the NICU this was a procedure you had to do every time so even if I had to step out into the hallway to take a phone call when I go back in had the charge nurse and washed hands again and that was just for safety security of not only our children but all the children in the NICU so another thing to note was that we actually had a list for our family that was maintained by the nurses and each family represented in the NICU or each baby represented and then thank you you could put I believe it was 10 people on your list who were approved to go in and see your babies and it as as our time in the NICU progressed that dwindled a little bit as some precautions got tighter due to flu season and RSV season but our older children were able to go in and see the NICU and see the babies uh we we all had to wear the yellow gowns when we were going to hold the babies and typically each person was only allowed to hold one baby a day which was very difficult for me as Mom going in to see three babies but I definitely understood the reasoning why we were not near our home so we couldn't go and shower or clean up between babies so there was always the chance of spread adding germs and they didn't want that to happen and of course neither did we so it was important that we maintained those sanitary procedures so the gowns in addition to also shoe covers I believe were also necessary [Music] so for me one of the best things about our particular NICU experience is the nurses and Doctor the staff as a whole was amazing and welcoming oftentimes you hear about dads not necessarily being treated equal to mom however that was not our experience and as I've actually come to find out through volunteering with March of Dimes that we actually had a very great and positive experience that a lot of dads don't get but me as a father the nursing staff doctor staff treated me the same as Mom they always we had Primary Care nurses who whenever they they would call and check in give they since they knew I was living back home in College Station and the girl over in Houston they would do the daily report for mom who was generally at the hospital at the time but then the evening report they would always call me and give the girl stats how they'd done that day what their feedings were like and then also they would just check in and say how's the week been going for you Dad how are things going with the older two so they they really focused on providing a Whole Health Care for us not just from the physical aspect but checking in on our mental health as parents and to see how we're doing with the hospital and the visitation they had 24-hour access which was nice because again with our children they were actually only limited to 20 30 minutes of time during their visit and oftentimes on weekends whenever everybody was down I would wake up like at three in the morning and just go to the hospital and hold babies for two or three hours and I got a luckily I had a lot of button-up shirts and so what I do is just sit there unbutton my shirt put them in and do the kangaroo care and just hold hold babies you know I it was a tough experience but loved every minute of it we also were blessed to be able to access some resources that the hospital provided for us um there's a child life specialist on staff there who was able to when our older children did come visit you know would she would come in and do visits and explain to them what those wires were for on their sisters why they needed to wear those that they weren't hurting them this is how we put it on you know when you're holding them make sure that it stays where it's supposed to and so that was great to have that explanation not just for them but for me too for me to understand why they were wearing things and to know that those weren't so scary and that it was okay if one got bumped off here and there uh and one could pull tubes out and she did and so having that explanation of those resources was really great for us [Music] it was a juggling act and then some um you know I was working full-time had to it was no choice the children had school we were very lucky in that we are public that we are public Educators we know the system and have friends that work in all districts and their teachers we were friends with the counselor at their school that our older two would go with so she was on top of them as far as making sure all their needs were met and we're able kind of knowing what we were would be facing that year she very specifically picked out all of their teachers for them um knowing that they would just need more than an education that year for me his dad just uh did a lot of driving for two months I logged I think roughly 7 000 miles driving back and forth to Houston uh was worth every minute um I would have to say that family and friends came out from everywhere her sister lives in Houston my parents both of our parents are from Waco so we had family very close by we have lots of friends from having been in the community for the amount of time we had we had friends all the time doing stuff like I would come home um Wednesday from my midweek visit to the girls and would find gift cards under our doormat we would we we would Sunday evening when I was driving back with the older two kids if you're getting phone calls say hey I know you are headed back from Houston what time are you going to be back and that's a expect to be back around this time like okay uh well dinner will be at your house by this time very very coordinated effort of the community around us I would say that kept things going back at home um and kept me in Houston truthfully I was very lucky when the girls were first born we immediately began planning I said I'm not leaving them here at the hospital without me and we didn't know how we were going to make that work and our community around us really rallied and through the kindness of friends who reached out to their friends I ended up moving in with a sweet retired couple in Houston who had never met me and I had never met them and they said she can come live with us and they became our surrogate grandparents and would drive me back and forth to the hospital and pack my lunchbox every day and just were amazing and Eric would come when he would come midweek he would also stay with them when he would bring the older kids up on the weekend they would come and stay with them and swim in their pool and we just became family and so knowing that there was such a coordinated effort from our church family and our community back home who really like Eric said rallied around and made sure every need that we had was met from the lawn being mode to the house being cleaned just laundry everything we could rest assured that if anything came up that needed to be taken care of they were going to be there and including when the girls were transferred from Houston back to the hospital and College Station we had a team community of people who were waiting outside the hospital to meet them and pray over them as they were locked inside so it was really we learned a lot about our community during that time which was very important because you hear about the quote-unquote pregnancy brain and things that happen well Nick your brain is about a thousand times worse [Music] I think for me because I was there really every day uh and seeing the babies around us who were not as blessed as we were and whose moms and dads couldn't be there with them every day and who had to go back to work and there was no other option they didn't have they weren't blessed with the community that we had so knowing that I needed to take advantage of the fact that I could be there and just be so thankful that I could be helped me a lot and knowing that it wouldn't be that way forever and that all my babies were healthy and that they were going to go home when so many around us were facing such harder trials than we were and babies who were so sick and had been there already for so long and just had there they didn't know when they were going to get home and so being able to to appreciate my situation but also walk through with other families really meant a lot to me in my journey um and knowing that my kids were in such good hands with their dad back home say the theme fight like a preemie the girls showed it every single day we the good thing that the NICU nurses and doctors do is they celebrate every single Milestone no mouth no matter how big or small I mean if it was today they went from eight millimeters to 10 millimeters of feeding they were celebrating it's today they kept their feeding tube in for the whole feeding as you mentioned Sylvie didn't ever did not cooperate with that and we had the friend that had to crochet an octopus which we will bring one day but every single Victory no matter how big or small the NICU staff made sure we were and celebrated and so it was it was very good because it showed that progress is progress no matter how big or small is and and it just showed that they were improving they were getting healthier day by day bit by day and that there would be an end to a journey they couldn't tell us when and didn't want to tell us when to not get our hopes up but they could always assure us that hey this is progress we are moving forward word every child is going to move at their own pace but we we are moving forward and so just having that constant not only having that constant hearing that constant reassurance but seeing it seeing them growth remember the first day that she sent me pictures like look real close and like oh my goodness that's so amazing now there are premium clothes and they still swallowed them up but it was it's wonderful because they had only been swaddled up to this point and couldn't wear real clothes and so now that they're big enough to actually put up real clothes it's like that was a huge thing for both of us to to see them like now they're almost they're real babies yeah they're real babies [Music] the bedside manner of doctors and nurses as I've spoken on many times that's one of the things that I will admire brag about tell everybody about until the day that I die is that the care provided by the doctors and nurses not only for our babies but again how much they focus on what I tell people as a whole family care in their their concerned for my health my mental health my well-being their concern for moms mental health moms mental well-being the NICU nurses you know we were in there for several holidays so like two of our primary nurses both made these amazing goodie bags for our older children for Halloween they um just their it's you know our doctor's experience that one just been minimal because we were both healthy had never had really any surgery or anything so didn't know what to expect but we had been told we do have friends who had babies in NICU and one of the things that one of them told us was um actually one particular friend whenever we found out that she was being life-flighted and she came up to visit me at the hospital before I raced to Houston she hugged my neck and she told me the last thing she told me was you're about to meet the most amazing medical people in the world and it's definitely true that being said I think it's I've talked about how lucky we were um we've heard so many stories from other families who had children in the NICU who didn't have the same experience that we did um so we do realize that every experience is different but ours was incredibly blessed we were also blessed in that our babies were such such Fighters and we're so healthy to begin with and like I said we didn't have surgeries we didn't have sickness you know and so many other families dealt with so much that was so hard and so I think that that maybe was the most surprising for me I guess within NICU families there's there's a saying that the NICU is a roller coaster and some days you're at the top and you can get to the bottom just as quickly and we we did have days like that especially early on where you know when things weren't so sure and they weren't so strong and they weren't so healthy yet and we would be doing really well and then the next day we would take and we were having a lot more episodes of apnea and breathing stopping and a couple of times when they did have to be resuscitated early on or caffeine things things like that so I think that maybe was the biggest shock for me of the NICU I guess is how different one day can be from the last you you can leave one day thinking okay we're doing great like they were awesome today there were no problems I remember talking to Eric at 11 o'clock at night sometimes and being like yeah they were all doing so good today they looked great and then I would get there at eight in the morning and they would be like yeah yeah I had 14 Brady's during the night and it was like oh but I thought we were doing so well um and you know the same with other families around us that you know one day was great and oh they're talking maybe we'll go home this weekend but then you know go home day would come and it was no we're gonna be here another week so just how different I think every day could be um and riding the Nikki roller coaster quite literally I think was a shock for us along the same lines when talking about the NICU roller coaster the one of the surprising things which is good is how serious they do take their health care and the apnea and the breathing and the heartbeat Sylvie who is the one that discharged first her initial discharge date she actually had an episode of that and they said no she's not going home today we want to keep her for three more days to Monitor and make sure that this doesn't happen again so while at that time it was very disheartening because we were so excited already I taken off from work and we were ready to bring her home but that happened but at the same time we know that there's a reason for that happen if that that it's good that it's there it was there and that the professionals are taking it that serious and they weren't going to waive because we could get home and she could have it and we don't have any of the fancy monitors or machines hooked up to her and something could happen while she's sleeping and we would have no clue.
