Today I'm in conversation with Essence yd and we're going to talk about the topic minority Health Equity we're so glad to have you here thank you it's so good to be here [Music] wow it's kind of like drinking from a water hose or a fire hose there is so much information out there for a first-time mom I would say that I am exhausted but it's also the most fun I've ever had my little one here will be 12 weeks on Wednesday and it's been a huge adjustment but I've been blessed to have a great community of family and friends and a wonderful supportive partner in my husband and I would say we're making it [Music] so I've been a part of the National Guard for the past eight years and being a mom in the military is something that I knew would be a bit of a struggle and it starts when you're pregnant there were a lot of things that I still wanted to do and was able to do but there were some aspects of my job that I couldn't do as well something about being out in the motor pool working on a diesel truck eight and a half months pregnant probably wasn't the best idea so I was lucky that my unit did have a modified workload for me according to Army standards so I was able to still do my job and do my training but in a way that worked with my pregnant body one thing that does make it difficult is when I do go to training having reliable Child Care is a big concern for myself as well as a lot of other military families and I do think it is harder sometimes on the military moms because with the dads they're expected to go away with military moms we're expected to be there so when I go to trading and I'm breastfeeding it just creates a little bit of a different challenge that you have to work through [Music] I did have several different health concerns or complications during my pregnancy I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes when I was about 10 weeks pregnant typically they don't even test for that until much later but I did have some risk factors that had been identified and I am so grateful that they tested me early and identified it early and that I was able to manage it better throughout my pregnancy I didn't even know that I that race and ethnicity was one of the predictive factors for that or I should say risk factors to be more specific and that was one of the things that really opened my eyes to the differences uh and health care and the differences in a disease and complication presentation amongst different ethnicities as well [Music] I am all about two things I would say number one would be research I place a lot of weight on the research and studies and opinions of the experts so I do spend a lot of time reading up on best practices for infants and child rearing and everything and then the other one is just Community I have such a large group of really amazing amazing women and moms and dads in this community and I do my best to pick their brains because maybe they've experienced something that I haven't so when they say that it takes a village I really lean into that [Music] my advice to other new moms is that you do know your baby best don't be afraid to voice concerns that you're having don't be afraid to ask questions there are no dumb questions when we're all trying to do what's best for our babies reach out if you need help whether that's mentally physically emotionally reach out to someone you trust friend family member professional and soak it all in this is only my first time but it's already going by so fast and just embrace it [Music] there is so much Mom guilt and it can be triggered by just about anything really and we're all just trying to do our best but still I worry every day am I feeding him enough is he sleeping enough when I go back to work how will I feel dropping him off at daycare letting someone else raise my kid and all of those thoughts just kind of jumble together in your head and it's something that I'm slowly trying to work through and give myself Grace to figure things out day by day and you know I'm not going to be a perfect mom none of us are we can't be and that's not the goal or it shouldn't be because you're just going to fall short every time so just learning to be gentle with myself and gentle with him because as much as he's learning to be a person in the world I I'm learning to be somebody's mom for the first time too [Music] so being a black woman because I can't answer every question so being a black woman and Pregnant was a bit of a scary time for me because I do like to research and I had seen the statistics on black mothers and complications in pregnancy and maternal death in black women is typically higher so going into pregnancy I was terrified I was terrified to be pregnant I was terrified to give birth I was scared that Sonny was going to miss something or I would just end up being another statistic and what helped me was once again being armed with the research so I did know the statistics but knowing them and trying not to be scared by them uh helped me be knowledgeable going into it so I could kind of reassure myself in some ways I also have a very supportive partner who was willing to be an advocate for me throughout the whole experience which was so immensely helpful and then finally my care team was absolutely phenomenal my OB just walked me through the gestational diabetes and was a wealth of knowledge and reassurance and by the end of it I said if she's not worried I'm not worried.
